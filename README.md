# 🏭 Preventing Industrial Disasters using IoT and Machine Learning  
### _A Real-Time Predictive Equipment Monitoring System_

---

## 📖 Overview

This project aims to prevent industrial disasters — such as gas leaks, equipment explosions, or chemical spills — through **real-time machine monitoring** and **predictive maintenance**.  
By combining **IoT sensors**, **Machine Learning**, and **data visualization**, the system continuously tracks the health of industrial machinery, detects faults early, and triggers **proactive alerts** before any catastrophic event occurs.

Inspired by the **Bhopal Gas Tragedy (1984)**, this solution focuses on giving machines a “voice” — allowing them to signal danger before it’s too late.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Industrial disasters are often caused by **ignored maintenance**, **faulty equipment**, or **disabled safety systems**.  
Even today, most industries rely on **manual inspections** and **reactive maintenance**, which are insufficient to detect early signs of equipment failure.  
The goal is to develop a system that monitors equipment **24/7**, identifies abnormalities in real time, and prevents accidents through **predictive intelligence**.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

The project proposes a **Proactive Equipment Monitoring System** that:

- 📡 Collects real-time data (temperature, vibration, gas levels) using IoT sensors.  
- 🧠 Analyzes data patterns using Machine Learning to predict faults.  
- 🚨 Sends proactive alerts to maintenance teams before failure occurs.  
- 📊 Displays insights through a live dashboard for easy visualization.
